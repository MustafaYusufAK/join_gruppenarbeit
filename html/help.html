        <p class="bold">Welcome to the Join help page!</p>
        This page is your guide to using our Kanban project management tool. Here, you'll learn what Join is, how it can
        benefit you, and how to use it to manage your projects more effectively.
        <h2>Description of Join</h2>
        Join is a project management tool based on the Kanban methodology, created by a dedicated group of students
        during their web development bootcamp at Developer Academy.
        <b>Important Considerations:</b>Join is primarily designed for educational purposes and is not intended for
        extensive enterprise use.
        <h2 class="headline">How does Join work</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Explore the Board:</strong> Upon logging into Join, you'll find a default board representing your project with four default lists: "To Do," "In Progress," "Waiting for Feedback," and "Done."</li>
            
            <li><strong>Create Contacts:</strong> In Join, you can add contacts for collaboration. Go to "Contacts," click "New Contact," and enter the required information. These contacts can be assigned tasks and collaborate on the board.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Add Cards:</strong> After adding contacts, start adding cards, which represent tasks. Click the "+" button under the relevant list, then fill in task details like name, description, due date, assignee, etc.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Move Cards:</strong> As tasks progress, drag and drop cards between lists to reflect changes on the board.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Delete Cards:</strong> When a task is complete, either move it to the "Done" list or delete it, but be cautious as deletion is irreversible.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="subheadline">Enjoy Using Join!</h2>
